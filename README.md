# Metamemory and Exclusion

The raw data of the experiments reported in the paper "Judgments of Learning Reflect the Encoding of Contexts, Not Items: Evidence from the Relationship between Judgments of Learning and Forgetting Functions on a Test of Recognition Exclusion"


## Sensitivity Analysis Scripts
PowerSim is the main file and it contains the full analysis to output simulations (Sim_Result.csv file).

It takes ~4 days to run the whole script on a regular computer.
Computer Specs:
Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz 1.99 GHz
Installed RAM 16.0 GB (15.8 GB usable)
System type 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor

It calls for the ContextFunctions.R, ContextFunctions_Ind.R, ItemFunctions.R, ItemFunctions_Ind.R files, so these dependencies should be in the same directory as the main file.
